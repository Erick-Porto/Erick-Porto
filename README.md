My journey began in 2016, where I learned to develop projects using C++. This awakened in me a passion for technology. Today, I graduated as a Developer and Computer Science Technician from the Federal Institute of Rio de Janeiro. I am currently graduating as a Technologist in Computer Systems at Universidade Federal Fluminense.

I am always looking for new opportunities to create innovative solutions that solve complex problems and add value. If you are looking for a committed and dedicated professional, ready to contribute with technological solutions and work as a team, here I am!
